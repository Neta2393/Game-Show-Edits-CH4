# Game-Show-Edits-CH4

## Purpose
The purpose of this README.md is to explain the functions and concepts for the game show edits CH4 repo. Within this read me you will read the logic and process behind the webpage. I hope that you can enjoy and see my ideas come to light while using CSS and JavaScript. 

## Contents
The contents of the repo include an assets folder that includes a script.js file and a style.css file. The repo also includes an index.html file. 

## Styling/Creation
This repo started with the creation of unique repo name. While working on the style.css and the script.js, I found ways to enhance the index.html file. Within my time at bootcamp I have learned how to create buttons within the index.html. Using the script.js I worked to make the buttons that I created in the index.html work and have a function within the buttons. All of the files and codes started with a blank page and I used help from past lessons and web sources to ensure that the functions worked as I wanted them to. Within the style.css file I worked to ensure the container 

## Function
When you arrive on the webpage you will see a Start button. When you click the start button you will be given the first of many questions. When you click the correct answer the contents of that answer button will turn yellow. If you click the incorrect answer the contents will remain white. When you click the next button you will be taken to the next question and the same thing will loop until you hit the end of the questions. Once you get to the final question there will be a restart button that will bbegin the quiz all over again.

## Trial and Error
While working on the following repo I came across some obstacles , but as I am learning in coding bootcamp just because it is a struggle now doesnt mean it will be later on. I am learning to rely on my resources and learning how to get better as time goes on. Now I can more accurately see the mistakes that I have made in the code. At times It is hard and frustrating when I cant get something, but I have no thought to quit learning. I hope that you can see the growth I have made in the following repo and I hope you enjoy it.
